# Castlequest

Built with Vue and currently hosted on castle.questifyer.com

I made this to be a quest giver at a festival in the Netherlands, with a number of quests for solo-players and for groups. Anyone is free to fork this and make their own version, all the quests are loaded from `src/quests.ts` and can be edited freely.

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
npm run dev   # for local development
npm run build   # for building for production
```
